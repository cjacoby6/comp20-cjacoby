It is not possible to request data from a different origin or from your local
machine because XMLHttpRequest has a same-origin policy. This means that any
other files accessed must be within the same domain to access them. This is
necessary for security purposes as any website one visits should not be given
access to other information stored on the computer - such as their info on
another site (such as their banking information).
